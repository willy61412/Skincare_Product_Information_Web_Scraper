### **Skincare Product Information Web Scraper**

This repository contains six web scraper files that extract detailed product data from six different skincare brands.

- Identify key differences by discovering unique ingredients or benefits that competitors offer but they do not.
- Assess product categories by analyzing the variety of product types between their products and those of competitors.
