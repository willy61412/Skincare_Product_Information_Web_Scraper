### **Skincare Product Information Web Scraper**

This repository contains six web scraper files that extract detailed product data from six different skincare brands. 

### Contributions

These files provide valuable insights into the differences in product lines among various brands, aiding in the development of effective product optimization strategies. 
This information can help companies to:

- Compare product portfolio to evaluate whether they have competitive price points across similar products.
- Identify key differences in ingredients and benefits, and discover unique products or ingredients that competitors offer but they do not.
- Assess differences in product categories by analyzing what different product types exist between their products and competitors' products.
- Evaluate consumer feedback differences to understand how consumer reviews and ratings vary between their products and those of competitors.

By leveraging these insights, companies can enhance their product offerings and improve overall performance.
